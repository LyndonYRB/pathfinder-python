# Pathfinder (made with Python)

I made it from a tutorial I found on youtube.

### How to run

You need to clone this repository and run the code on your device and the install pygame.

```jsx
pip install pygame
```

To start the app

```jsx
python3 pathfinder.py
```

or

```jsx
python pathfinder.py
```

- Hold the right-click button on the mouse anywhere on the grid to select a target box (yellow)

- Use left click to draw the wall (light gray)

- Press any key to start the algorithm to reach the target box. Green means that the box has been checked by the algo, red means that the
box is queued

## Requirements

pygame==2.1.2

```jsx
pip install pygame
```
